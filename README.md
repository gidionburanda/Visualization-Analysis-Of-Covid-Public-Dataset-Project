In an effort to help combat COVID-19, we created a COVID-19 Public Datasets program to make data more accessible to researchers, data scientists and analysts. The program will host a repository of public datasets that relate to the COVID-19 crisis and make them free to access and analyze. These include datasets from the New York Times, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, Google, Global Health Data from the World Bank, and OpenStreetMap.
